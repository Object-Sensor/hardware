# Object Sensor Hardware Component
- Designed with Arduino UNO, ESP8266, and Ultrasonic Sensor as a part of a ongoing larger project.
- The device detects objects withing a range of 5 meters in front of the sensor. As a future development 3 more sensors will be added to detect objects in all four directions.
- The device connects to a Wi-Fi network using the ESP8266 module. We configured an additional Serial connection between the ESP8266 and Arduino. 
- The data is sent to an open source (ThinkSpeak) API where we can see the sensor data visualized. 
- In the future we are going to use our own API which is under development as well as a iOS app to display the sensor data

This hardware component of the project was created by: Sara Habib (sarausama), Simon Bell (s26bell), and Daniel Croos (DanielCroos)
